        <P> <!-- Each quote starts new line because they are block quotes -->
            <blockquote>"My husband and I experienced something new and wonderful every single day! It was all the little things that made our stay in The Bahamas the best vacation we have taken. We are planning to make The Bahamas a yearly vacation spot. We have kept in contact with our new 'family' since the day we left, and plan on staying in contact." 
                <br /><h5> --Tracey S. (Date of visit: January 2011)</h5></blockquote>
            <blockquote>"The Bahamas was the best trip I have ever taken, and Padua Panda Travel Agency allowed us to see and experience every aspect we wanted to. We were able to snorkel, visit the wild pigs, see all three national parks, enjoy a luxurious resort, and try new food all for an affordable price."
                <br /><h5> --Matt P. (Date of visit: March 2017) </h5></blockquote>
            <blockquote>"We stayed at the Coastal Winds for eight days in Feb.-March. The house is in a safe quiet gated community. The grounds are immaculately kept with a hot tub, pool and gardens. Our suite was a one bedroom condo type accommodation with a living room kitchen combination. It was very roomy and tastefully decorated. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots and pans, coffee maker, toaster, etc. We usually made breakfast and dinner there and ate our lunch out. Everything was so well kept and clean. The property is not on the beach so a car or other means of transport would be helpful. The pool and hot tub were very well maintained. I only have positive things to say about this beautiful property. The Padua Pandas Travel Agency allowed us the oppurtunity to rent this gorgeous house for a great price."
                <br /><h5> --Michelle R. (Date of visit: April 2019) </h5></blockquote>
